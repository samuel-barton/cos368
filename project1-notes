    Input features for non-shopping sites
    -------------------------------------

        23. For each input you try:

            b. was the input mechanism easy to understand and use?

            c. Were select menus, check boxes, radio buttons used where
               appropriate in lieu of text boxes?

            d. Is there an opportunity for free entry of text that has some
               constraint on validity? If yes, try entering invalid data.
               Does it prevent entry? does it give useful feedback? does it
               explain what the needed pattern is?

            e. If the data is entered by checkboxes or select menus and there is
               a clearly inconsistent set of choices, try making it to see if the
               site catches the error. Does it prevent the choice? Does it give
               understandable feedback that the choice is invalid?

    Summary Questions for All Sites
    -------------------------------

        A. Identify any features of each that you thought were especially effective,

        C. Make a summary judgement on whether the sites are equally effective
           or one appears better than the other and defend your choice.

COS 368    Graphical User Interface Design

Project  1:  Comparing Web Sites

Due:

Written Part: Submitted to Blackboard by Saturday, 2/18, 8 AM
Oral Presentations: we will schedule them for the two weeks after the winter break;
                                  I would like you to submit your slides before the talk is delivered

General Discussion of the Assignment
==============================

This is to be done in teams of two, but if we have an odd number, one team will need to
have a third member.

There is a written part to the assignment, based on the the evaluation criteria
given below.  Each team will also give a 10-20 minute presentation(5-10 minutes
for each team member) in class.  There should be one submission of a written part per
team, but each team member should should submit a list of the slides used in his or her
talk before the talk.  If overhead slides are used, you can photograph or scan them.

Below is a list of several broad areas of websites.  You are to identify a teammate
and pick an area and from that area pick two specific sites and compare them using
the listed criteria.

For each criterion, give a brief description of each site's features w.r.t it, and
whether the sites were equivalent with respect to the criterion or one site was better
than the other, and why you think so.  If members of the team disagreed in the ranking,
that should be noted and each side should offer their reasons for their ranking.

The criteria provides an opportunity for you to include other aspects or features
not listed, and you should do that if there were prominent features that you cannot
fit into any of the listed ones.

The talk should present a selection of a few of the more salient features of the sites,
possibly things that you think were done well, things that you think were done poorly,
or features that really distinguished the sites.  You won't be able to cover them all, so
you should select what you believe to be the most important.  You will likely want
to have a laptop to demonstrate the features you mention, but it may be better to
do a screen capture for a backup in case the site is down; that is a low probability
event, but would be a problem if it happened. If you prefer, you can prepare overhead
projector slides rather than powerpoint style, but you should have some slides where
you make your points and some examples from the website supporting your claims.
With this as with any talk you ever give, it is wise to give it at least once beforehandâ€¨to time yourself and practice it.

IMPORTANT: The team should confer so that each member addresses different
aspects.  If there is some disagreement over who does what, I suggest you flip a
coin for who picks first, then alternate choosing.

Learning Objectives
===============

1.  To have you consciously and critically examine sites from a user interface
designer's perspective, making a point of thinking about the interface.  We will
be reading texts later to sharpen your perception of UI aspects, but here we
provide some criteria for you to use.

2. To have you collaborate with another person.  Our advisory board  stresses
the importance of collaborative work at their establishments, and wants us to have
more such experiences in our curriculum.  I expect you to work with your team and
to discuss your responses collectively.  You may want to visit the sites separately
at first, but you should definitely visit them together to compare your observations.
It is not required that you converge to a single evaluation, but if you differ, you
should say so and explain.  You will have several weeks to do this, and if there
are any issues with the functioning of the teams, I would like you to bring them to
me.

3. To have you give an oral presentation.  In almost any work environment you
will need to present information you gathered to others.  It is something that can
be scary the first time but becomes easier with practice.

Evaluation Criteria I will use
=====================

1. For the written assignment, I will visit the sites myself and check your work for
accuracy.  Certainly much of our response to a site's aesthetics is subjective, but
you should try to be objective where you can.  I will consider the completeness
of your submission, i.e.,  that you did consider each of the criteria.  There may be some
items that are not as important for some sites and you can indicate that in your
response.  For example, some sites may not have as much opportunity for the user to supply
input values as other sites do.  I will also assess the quality of your writing.  The
answers should be grammatically correct sentences using appropriate words,
correctly spelled.   A lengthy response calls for a sensible organization of the answer
into paragraphs.   Writing should be of the quality required in a paper for the English
department.

2.  For the oral presentation, I will be considering

a. evidence that you prepared the talk(stay within the time bounds, slides are prepared
in advance, demonstrated familiarity with your material)

b. organization(it is common for a talk to begin with an overview of what is coming, and
you should have an initial slide that identifies your team and you, the websites you
looked at, and the specific features/aspects/criteria your presentation will consider;
you should make some concluding, summary evaluation about how the sites compared
based on what you presented, even if that conclusion would be contradicted by other
features; what I mean by this is that considering all aspects, you may regard X as
better than Y, but if you are only looking at aspects in which Y is better, you should
draw the conclusion that your presentation supports;  note, this also may require you
to weight some aspects more than others)

c. oral expression(your thoughts were clearly expressed in correct English and
you spoke so everyone could hear you-- if we were in a large auditorium it would be wise
to use a sound system and ask the audience if it were set adequately, but in our
room your speaking voice should be adequate)

d. content(primarily that the claims made are supported by evidence presented with
them, but also a knowledge of what is desirable w.r.t a criterion)

e. although I would not necessarily use it in assigning a grade, I think it could be
very useful for the class to provide some feedback, too;  these presentations
are intended to give you practice and identify strengths and aspects that can be
improved; I need to figure out a delivery mechanism for class feedback, however;

Website Areas
============

So you are not comparing apples to oranges, I have tried to put sites into
groups where the purposes of the sites in a group are more or less the same.

The areas are

1. news dispensing, broken down further by the kind of publication the
site is the web presence of(newspaper, periodical, ...)

2. shopping or commercial, broken down further by the nature of the
items being sold

3. museums and art galleries

In the case of news organizations, I have grouped them by my guess of
their editorial slant, liberal or conservative and I want you to pick one of
each.   As I am not fully familar with  all of them my labels may not be fair.
Certainly some of the ones I am familiar with are not wholly one way.  For
example, the New York Times has some conservative columns and
The Economist takes some positions that would be regarded as liberal or
Democratic in this country.

Even with that disclaimer over the accuracy of my labeling, I think it is
worthwhile to include different outlets but you should not let your agreement
or disagreement with the tenor of the outlet color your evaluation of the
effectiveness of the site as an information dispensing website.

You should visit two sites and  spend 2 to 4 hours exploring them.

In all cases, you should spend some initial time getting the lay or geography
of the site by examining the entry page and its major headings, and trying
a few of them.  You should determine how the site is organized before
pursuing a more  specialized task, which is a pretense for the purpose of
the exercise.  It is better for you to use sites that you are NOT already
familiar with so you confront it as a novice or first time user.

You may suggest a different category altogether, but it needs to have
sites of comparable complexity.  For example, you might pick two
university sites.

Specialized Tasks for the Categories
=============================

Imagining yourself to be a typical user may help to focus your attention
on the helpfulness of the site, so we ask you to assume a role
during your visit.

In the case of a commercial site, I would like you to act as if you were
shopping for gifts for family or friends and go through the motions of
purchasing some items, stopping just short of actually buying anything.

In the case of an information site, you should act as if you are researching
some particular event in the news, so you should look for articles that are
related to the event, exposing its search capabilities.  Use the same event
for the two sites.  If the site has a free trial subscription period, you may
sign up for it, or if a full subscription, fill out its forms stopping just short of
committing any money, so you can see the form input features it has.

In the case of a museum site you should imagine you are planning a trip and
are considering visiting the place, so you want to gain an understanding of
what its permanent collection holds, any special events during your visit
(pick some week in the not too distant future), hours of operation, etc.

Make a point of picking a site that you are not already familiar with.

If you are using an entirely different area from these listed, you will need
to suggest a purpose to the visit.  For example, if it were a university site,
you might take the role of a prospective student investigating course
offerings, costs, etc.


Site Areas
========

Within any of these areas, you may suggest alternatives, but they
should not be sites you already are very familiar with.

Evaluation Criteria- General Criteria to Use for All Sites
==========================================

In some cases the questions may be less applicable to the kind of sites
you are comparing, but do the best you can.  If team members disagree
on specific criteria, then the points of agreement and disagreement
should be identified.  There is not necessarily a right answer, but
you should try to understand the source of the difference of
evaluation.


1. In general terms, characterize the purpose of the website and, if possible,
what assumptions the developers would be justified in making about its users.


Organization and Navigation
---------------------------------------

2.  Is the site's organization reasonably simple to understand, with features
hierarchically organized into reasonably chosen larger groups and and links
clearly labeled  with informative text?

3. Is navigation of the website easy, in particular, if you are searching for specific
information, could you find it quickly?

4. Does the site provide appropriate feedback(banner, labels, etc.) to
operations or selections to help the user understand his/her context?

5. Does the user have to remember information from an earlier page that is
no longer displayed?  Re-enter form data that has been entered once?

6. Did the website have a local search engine?  If yes, try it for an item
that you know is there and one you know is not there.  Does it respond
clearly in the case of  both searches?

7. Did you get lost in the interface and have a difficult time returning to the
entry page or an earlier page w/o using the browser's history?  were there
links back?

8. Did all pages have a link back to the entry/home page?

9.  Did the pages have a consistent appearance so that you could tell you were
within the site?  Was there a common banner on all pages?

10. Did you encounter any broken links, or pages that faulted?   After you have
explored it, you might try

http://validator.w3.org/checklink

to test the links.   This took over five minutes of cpu time for the USM site,
so you may want to leave it running at the end of the day.

11. How difficult was it to accomplish the presumed task of your visit?  are there
other things the site might have done to make it easier to accomplish your task?


Content and Presentation of Content
---------------------------------------------------

12.  Was the textual content of the site well written, accessible English that you
could readily understand?

13. Was all of  the text legible as delivered, fonts large enough and readable,
letters colored in a manner distinct from background, etc.?

14. Apart from the static text, were all error messages or messages that
report progress of operations or other dynamically generated text clear and
understandable and presented legibly?

15. Did you think the images were well chosen to support the textual discussion?
Did you think "Gee, I wish they had a picture of ..." for something that was not there?

16. Do the images displayed all have text captions?  Try hovering  the mouse over
a few.  Does a tooltip style text pop up?  Images are presented with the HTML
img element and should always have the alt attributes with alternative text
for the visually impaired.  Use the browser tools to inspect a random choice of
three and see how many have the alt attribute with something other than the empty string.

17. How was the graphic appearance of the site?  Was it too dull/drab?
too busy/garish?

18. Was color used effectively?

19.  We assume that the site had text and images.  Did it also have sound and
video?  If yes, were they used effectively, that is, well-chosen as accompaniments
to the text?

20.  Did the site have advertising?  Was the advertising intrusive or make it
difficult to get to the information on the site?

21. Was the site's privacy policy clearly and prominently accessible, in particular
was there any discussion of whether the site records data about your visit?

22. Include any other aspects that you think were important to your experience
of the site but are not covered by any of these criteria.

Additional Criteria Specific to Shopping Sites
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you are comparing shopping sites, go through the motions of making
a purchase, but do not complete it unless you really want the item.


23.  When patterned data (dates, credit card numbers, etc.) is required,  how does
it deal with invalid data entry?  (there are several possibilities; it might disable some
keys, it might give immediate feedback on entry or it might give an error message
at an attempt to submit the form)  Does the feedback make it clear what pattern of
data is needed?  Does it use an example?  What help does it provide to the
user entering data where some data can be invalid?  You might trying giving a
number for your name or an invalid email address to see how it responds.

24. Were select menus used instead of text boxes where appropriate?

25. Were check boxes used instead of text boxes where appropriate?

26. Was there a clear sequencing of steps of the transaction that was plain to the
user?

27. Were there clear opportunities to change the order right up to committing
the transaction?

28. Was there an explanation of the security provided for credit card numbers?  If yes,
was it understandable?

Input Features of Non-shopping Sites
-----------------------------------------------------

If there were opportunities for you to sign up for something, add a comment,
generally some feature that requires input from you, it would be great if you
could explore it, BUT DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.  If there are such opportunities, please
answer the following

23. There may be several distinct opportunities(make a donation to the
organization, signing up to a mailing list, subscribing to the publication,
etc.).  For each that you try, answer the following.

a. briefly characterize what the purpose of the opportunity is(making a donation,
etc.)

b. was the input mechanism easy to understand and use?

c. to prevent user keying errors, were select menus, check boxes and
radio buttons used where appropriate in lieu of text boxes?

d. is there an opportunity for free entry of text that has some constraint
on validity(e. g., credit card numbers, dates, etc.)?  If yes, try entering
invalid data to see how the site responds.  Does it prevent the entry?
does it give useful feedback?  does it explain what the needed
pattern is?

e. if the data is entered by checkboxes or select menus and there is a clearly
inconsistent set of choices, try making it to see if the site catches
the error.  Does it prevent the choice?  Does it give understandable
feedback that the choice is invalid?


Summary Questions for All Sites
----------------------------------------------

A. Identify any features of each that you thought were especially effective,
or attractive or surprised you.

B. Identify any features of each that you thought were particularly dismal
or unfortunate design choices.

C. Based on your survey, make a summary judgment on whether the sites
are equally effective (or ineffective)  or one appears better than the other
and defend your choice.  Especially here, points of agreement and
disagreement within the team should be identified, thought given to
its cause and some explanation.  It could be the a difference in emphasis
or weight given to one aspect or another, possibly something in that site
that resonated with one individual more than the other.

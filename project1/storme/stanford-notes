PROJECT CRITERIA
================

    Site:   Standford University (https://www.stanford.edu)





Evaluation Criteria :: General Criteria for all sites
=====================================================

    1.  Characterize the purpose of the website; what assumptions the devs
        would be justified in making about its users.

            The website is a hub for all information and resources for Stanford
            University. It provides: history of Stanford, campus maps info & tours,
            contact information for faculty, Stanford news & events, admission
            information, academic information (sites for individual schools, departments,
            programs, calendar), research info, campus/student life info (living
            resources, athletics & fitness, arts & culture, activities).

            The devs would be justified in assuming the primary use (if not the
            exlusive use) of the site is to **find information**. Whether the
            user is a current student, prospective student, parent, faculty, or
            alumni, they are probably coming to the site to find some information
            be it a phone number, an email address, a date, a time, a deadline,
            a form, etc.

            Because of this, I would expect a very high quality search engine,
            and high attention to organization and navigation.



    Organization / Navigation
    -------------------------

        2.  Is the organization simple to understand? Hierarchical organization?
            Links clearly labeled with informative text?

                The organization is very simple to understand. The organization
                is hierarchical.

                - The highest level of organization are the four **gateways**
                  or views into the site & database. On the home page there are
                  four clearly labeled buttons: Students, Faculty/Staff,
                  Parents, Alumni. The Students and Faculty/Staff buttons lead
                  to "Gateway" pages, which take sections and links from around
                  the site that are relevant to either Students or Faculty and
                  list them on a single page. These sections are verbatim from
                  other parts of the site (as in, I'm pretty sure the HTML elements
                  are verbatim), they are just filtered and organized for the
                  target audience.

                  The Parents and Alumni buttons actually take you to different
                  sites: parents.stanford.edu & alumni.stanford.edu. These are
                  disconnected from the content on stanford.edu and have new
                  banners, buttons, and information. parents.stanford.edu follows
                  the same layout as stanford.edu, but provides information specific
                  to parents. However, alumni.stanford.edu has a completely different
                  format, layout, and organization than the main site. In fact, it
                  almost seems as if alumni.stanford.edu is an older layout, perhaps
                  what the main site used to look like before an update? It is much
                  harder to use than the main site and has a busier organization
                  scheme.

                - The next level of organization are the main section tabs on the
                  home page of the website. These are: About Stanford, Admission,
                  Academics, Research, Campus Life. These tabs persist throughout
                  stanford.edu. Each tab contains sections each with bullet points
                  (clickable links) to more specific information under that section
                  header. For example, the About Stanford section contains the
                  subsection Stanford Facts & History which itself contains a brief
                  summary of the section, and three bullet points: Stanford Facts,
                  Annual Report, and History.

                  The sections and bullet points under these main tabs are the
                  sections that are filtered under the Student and Faculty
                  gateways.

                - The next level of organization is the specific information
                  level. This is an extremely intuitive organization scheme
                  and is, for me, the highlight of the website.

                  For every bullet link in level 2, there is a site X.stanford.edu
                  where X is a brief descriptor of that bullet. For example,
                  clicking the Stanford Facts link from earlier will take you to
                  facts.stanford.edu. Each of these sites follow the same organization
                  scheme as the top level stanford.edu. So these sites themselves
                  each have tabs and subsections, but only related to specific info.

                  This scheme isn't 100% true all of the time. Some links take you
                  to subsections of the main site, but for the most part, large sections
                  of information are contained in a single X.stanford.edu.

        3.  Is navigation easy? Could you find specific information quickly?

                Navigation is very easy. Taking the role of a prospective grad
                student looking for an MS in Computer Science, I set out to find
                the application deadline for that program. Starting from the
                home page (stanford.edu), I found the answer I was looking for
                in only 3 button presses and 1 search without having to go 'back' with
                my browser.

                    i.   Clicked the Admission tab
                    ii.  Under the Graduate section, clicked Graduate Admission.
                         This took me to gradadmissions.stanford.edu
                    iii. Searched for Computer Science in the centered search
                         field.
                    iv.  Clicked on the "Computer Science" result.

                Another test I tried was finding CS grad specializations for the
                MSCS. I used the search engine to search for "Computer Science",
                and clicked the top result which took me to www-cs.stanford.edu.
                Here I used the main navigation bar to go to academics>current masters>
                choosing a specialization. This brought me to a page with all
                MSCS specializations. Each had a blurb about the program, some
                links to courses in the program, links to professors in the program,
                and links to other resources related to the program.

        4.  Does it provide appropriate feedback to operations?

                TODO: don't know where you came from etc. navigation

        5.  Does the user have to remember information from an earlier page that is
            no longer displayed? Re-enter form data?

                We can't really do these types of form entries because of the
                nature of the site.

        6.  Local search engine? Does it respond clearly?

                The local search engine uses Google Custom Search (go figure),
                so it is very fast and the output format is familiar.

                On the main page, the search control in the top right has two
                modes selected by radio buttons: Web, and People. The search
                page www.stanford.edu/search/ also provides additional modes:
                Organizations and Campus Map.

                The Web and Campus Map search environments are exceptionally good.
                They are responsive and familiar to any google user.

                However the People and Organizations search environments are very poor.
                The tools are cluttered on the page and there is too much information
                being displayed at once. For example, A People search for "Joe Schmo"
                which has no results, demonstrates how cluttered the interface is.
                Upon brief inspection of the results page I wouldn't immediately
                know whether there were results or not because the page is so
                messy, and the results string "No Matches in Public Directory"
                is too small.

                Another test I tried is searching for "Computer Science" in the
                People search environment. This also produced no results, but
                didn't suggest to me the possibility that I used the wrong
                search environment, even though it provides other suggestions
                like trying different filters or directories.

        7.  Did you get lost/have a difficult time getting back to earlier page
            w/out browser?

                I did get lost at times. It is always possible to get back to
                www.stanford.edu from any part of the site, but it is not always
                possible to get back to the page you immediately came from. I
                don't think this is a problem, it is clear the developers/designers
                rely on using back/forward and search history so that they do
                not need to implement their own controls within the site. It is
                still easy to find information and review larger sections of
                information before digging deeper.

        8.  Did all pages have a link back to the entry/home page?

                Kind of, the "Stanford" logo in the top left of every page takes
                you back to www.stanford.edu. However, some pages are dead-ends
                and have no such stanford logo. These are usually pages managed
                by specific groups in specific departments. This is comparable to
                a USM professor personal site not having a direct link to
                usm.maine.edu, I don't think it is expected or necessary.

                The handful of pages that do not link back to the main site
                at all are the sites for each individual School. The "stanford"
                logo on these sites links back to the home page of that school's
                site only. I actually found this to be convenient while I was
                browsing the school of engineering

        9.  Did the pages have a consistent appearance?

                For the most part. All of the main pages and primary sections
                have a consistent and very professional appearance. As you dig
                deeper into any one departments more specific pages, there is a
                distinct change of appearance. I expect this is because less-technical
                folks are designing or styling the web pages. These pages are
                usually more function-over-form. An example of this is
                the Stanford InfoLab page (infolab.stanford.edu).

        10. Did you encounter broken links or bad pages?
            Try http://validator.w3.org/checklink

                I ran stanford.edu using http://validator.w3.org/checklink,
                and it wasn't perfect. According to the checker, the
                website has 12 forbidden links (code 403), 3 broken links
                (code 404), and one gateway timeout on a link (code 504).

                There were also 13 warnings regarding links that were redirects,
                which cause browser performance issues. These links technically
                work, but need to redirect and forward requests before the
                request is satisfied. These are human errors that can be
                fixed, but haven't.

        11. How difficult was it to accomplish the presumed task of your visit?
            Are there things the site might have done to make it easier?

                The task of my visit was to learn about the application process,
                financing, and offerings regarding an MS in Computer Science.
                I found everything I was looking for without any problems. Usually
                I can find what I'm looking for without using the search engine,
                but when I'm stumped, the search engine works perfectly well.



    Content and Presentation of Content
    -----------------------------------

        12. Was text content well-written, accessible, easily understood?

                Yes, the english is good. I found at least one spelling error
                on the Computer Science site, but other than that the text content
                is well-written.

        13. Were fonts large enough, readable? Was text/background coloring good?

                Yes, the background is white, the main text is black, and
                any highlights or accents are boldface cardinal (stanford color).

                Everything is readable and the Cardinal/black text provides
                a nice environment for quickly visually scanning a page.

                However, the typeface is sans serif, and the smaller sans serif
                text is kind of hard for me to read. This might just be a personal
                preference.

        14. Were error messages or progress reports clear and understandable?

                TODO

        15. Were images well chosen / support the text?

                Images were well chosen. If a page talks about a person, there
                is a picture of that person somewhere on the page.

        16. Do all images have text captions? Do they have tooltips? Choose (3)
            images to inspect the alt attribute of.

                TODO

        17. How was the graphic appearance of the site? dull/drab? busy/garish?

                The graphic appearance of the site is good for the most part.

                One strange thing to note that is relevant these days is the
                following: I use a MacBook Pro with a Retina display screen
                This screen has a really high resolution. Most of the custom
                icons and images on the Stanford website are bitmap images
                that are not high-enough resolution for the Apple Retina display.
                This makes some parts of the website very ugly. It is hard to
                find the tradeoff between images sizes and image quality, but
                many major websites have begun to accomodate these new ultrahigh
                resolution monitors.

        18. Was color used effectively?

                Yes. Color was used in two ways: to emphasize text and to
                make widgets and navigation tools visually pop off the background.

                For the most part Stanford's school colors were used (cardinal and white)
                and dark grey accents. This reinforces the branding of the
                university and makes the visuals very pleasing.

        19. Did it have sound / video? Were they used effectively?

            TODO

        20. Did the site have advertising? Was the adv. intrusive or make it
            difficult to get to information on the site?

                I found no advertising on the site, other than in the About
                pages for prospective students.

        21. Was the site's privacy policy clearly and prominently accessible?
            Does the site record data about your visit?

                I could not find the site's privacy policy at all, or any
                mention of whether the site records data about my visit. Unfortunately
                due to the nature of a university, there are more than one
                "Privacy Policy" for the organization, so the search engine
                isn't any help.

        22. Anything else?

                Nope.


    Input features for non-shopping sites
    -------------------------------------

        23. For each input you try:

            a. Briefly characterize what the purpose of the input is.

            b. was the input mechanism easy to understand and use?

            c. Were select menus, check boxes, radio buttons used where
               appropriate in lieu of text boxes?

            d. Is there an opportunity for free entry of text that has some
               constraint on validity? If yes, try entering invalid data.
               Does it prevent entry? does it give useful feedback? does it
               explain what the needed pattern is?

            e. If the data is entered by checkboxes or select menus and there is
               a clearly inconsistent set of choices, try making it to see if the
               site catches the error. Does it prevent the choice? Does it give
               understandable feedback that the choice is invalid?



    Summary Questions for All Sites
    -------------------------------

        A. Identify any features of each that you thought were especially effective,
           or attractive or surprised you.

        B. Identify any features of each that you thought were particularly dismal
           or unfortunate design choices.

        C. Make a summary judgement on whether the sites are equally effective
           or one appears better than the other and defend your choice.

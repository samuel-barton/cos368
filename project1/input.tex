\section*{Input Features}

\subsubsection*{Purpose}

For both Stanford and MIT the best solution for testing their respective input handling capabilities was to execute
various searches utilizing each sites' local search engine. These searches ran the gamut from simple phrases to 
Javascript code snippets.

\subsubsection*{Mechanism Undstandability and Usability}

            The searching functionality on the MIT site was very effective as the search
            bar is always located on the top right and is reasonably prominent relative
            to the rest of the page. Beyond that, the search space is determined by both
            one's current position in the site hierarchy, and, in some cases, the mode
            of search being done. From the home page there is the option to search the
            entire site, the `people' of MIT, or the offices of MIT. These detailed
            customizations of the search space made searching much more focused and useful.

\subsection*{Non-texual Input Supplementation}

            Radio buttons were used, as mentioned in the previous section, in a very useful
            way on the MIT site. The scope of the search was automatically chosen dependent
            on one's location in the sites hierarchy, but in those cases where further search
            customization would be helpful radio buttons appeared above the search bar to select
            search categories.
			
\subsection*{Validation}

            The MIT search engine will accept any kind of information, and in most cases will just
            search through the site for whatever is typed in; however, if one attempts to execute an
            attack via entering Javascript code into the search box (e.g. \texttt{javascript::alert(``Hello World!''1)}),
            the site will not let the search go through but when the search is submitted will send
            the user to \url{http://web.mit.edu/cgi-bin/search-route-new} and tell them that they
            cannot access the page. There is no explanation anywhere as to what the user is expected to
            enter for data, and thus the user is left to their own devices to determine what they can or
            cannot search. Searching for non-alphabet characters \{!,@,[,*,/,\%,...\} has no adverse effect on
            the search experience, the search engine simply attempts to find relavent information containing
            those ``words''.

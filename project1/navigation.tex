\section*{Organization and Navigation}
\subsection*{Site Organization --- Clear or Intractable?}

Initially the MIT system is straightforward but it very quickly breaks down as while
the organization is hierarchical once you descend down into some sub portion of
the site, there is often no good way to get back to the home page, or even some
intermediary parent page. Some of the links are clearly labeled, but others are
nothing more than a hyperlinked number.

The home page is a portal from where you can get to wherever you need to go, and
from there the site becomes inconsistent. This is jarring at times, and it makes
navigating from one sublevel of the hierarchy to another without going back to the
parent level nearly, if not entirely, impossible.

On the other hand, the Stanford site provides a clean and effective hierarchical
organization. The system is split into three layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the upper-right corner the main page (\url{https://www.stanford.edu})
    there are four buttons: \textsl{STUDENTS}, \textsl{FACULTY/STAFF},
    \textsl{PARENTS}, and \textsl{ALUMNI}. These buttons lead to \textit{gateway}
    pages, which filter content from the site in the interest of the selected group.
    For example, if you are a student visiting the site, you can select the
    \textsl{STUDENTS} gateway to visit a page containing links to student-related content.

    The \textsl{STUDENTS} and \textsl{FACULTY/STAFF} gateway pages are extensions
    of the main site, and filter sections from \textsl{organization layer 2}
    verbatim. The \textsl{PARENTS} and \textsl{ALUMNI} gateway pages are actually
    independent sites: \url{https://parents.stanford.edu} and
    \url{https://alumni.stanford.edu}. The content on these sites are different
    than that on the main site, which greatly reduces clutter on the main page.

    \item The next level of organization is given by the tabs under the
    Stanford University logo on the first page. Under each of these tabs are
    sections containing links to other parts of the site. These sections are
    the same ones that are filtered by the \textsl{STUDENTS} and
    \textsl{FACULTY/STAFF} gateways.

    As an example, the ``About Stanford'' tab contains the section
    ``Stanford Facts \& History'', which itself contains a summary of the
    section and some links.

    \item The last level of organization is given by the links under the
    sections in \textsl{organization layer 2}. These links lead you deeper
    into the site.

    For almost every link, there is a page \texttt{$x$.stanford.edu} where
    $x$ is a brief descriptor of the page. For example, clicking the
    ``Stanford Facts'' link under the ``Stanford Facts \& History'' section
    from earlier will take you to \url{https://facts.stanford.edu}. This is
    where the hierarchical organization of the Stanford website begins to shine,
    as the site \url{https://facts.stanford.edu} is itself organized using these
    same three organization layers. This kind of consistency makes it really easy
    to find your way around most of the main page.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Site Navigation --- Easy or Difficult?}

Navigation down the hierarchy of pages is reasonably straightforward. Information
was easy to find, but once the information has been found navigating back to where
you came from is rather difficult. Even though the site generally clear on where to
go to find information, searching for something specific would, in almost all cases,
yield the desired result much more quickly. A search will give the desired input in
one step, whereas navigation will take several steps in nearly all cases.

\subsection*{Operation Feedback --- Present or Lacking?}

There is very little to no operation feedback present on the MIT website. There is no 
clear way to see where you have come from, or your current
position within the site's hierarchy beyond looking at the URL in your web browser. Thus
clicking on a link, while the animation of a hyperlink is still perfectly valid, does not
give any persistent information as to where you've come from once the new page has loaded.

\subsection*{Remeber Old Information / Form Reentry --- FIX THIS!!!!}

Since the MIT site is more informative than interactive, and those parts which are interactive
are inaccessable to us, this question is unapplicable.

\subsection*{Site Search Engine --- Responsive or Unusable?}

The MIT site has a very well thought out search engine which is local to the user's current
position within the site's hierarchy. Thus at the home page of the site the search engine
works across the entire MIT website, and at every department's main page the search is
across the department's pages. The responses of the search engine are both clear and
reasonably ordered.

\subsection*{Where Am I, and Can I Get Back to Where I Was?}

Unfortunately, the designers of the MIT website left out any form of position tracking within
the site's hierarchy, so getting lost is nearly effortless. The only solution for getting back
to earlier pages, which is generally implemented but not always, is to go back to the root by
locating, and clicking on, the MIT logo, which then takes you back to the home page where you
can navigate back to wherever you wish to go. This oversight makes the website much more
difficult to navigate in, and is one of the major downsides to its design.

\subsection*{Can I get Home?}

Yes. In most cases the MIT logo appears somewhere in the page's header, and clicking on that
will bring you back to the homepage. On those pages where the logo does not exist, as well as
on all other pages, there is a small footer at the very bottom of the page with the MIT logo
which will also bring you back to the home page.

\subsection*{Does the Site Maintain its Appearance?}

No. The main page of the MIT site is styled like a portal with the information displayed in such a way as to
only use up one screen's worth of space. Each child page was formatted slightly differently.
Departments each have their own unique theme which the majority of their pages hold to, and
individual faculty often have a personalized page with another different style.

The constant changes in page styling, combined with the total lack of a consisten header and
menu, were quite jarring. As one navigated through the site it would be easy to initially
come to the incorrect conclusion that they had been redirected away from MIT's site entirely.

\subsection*{Human Error in Site Development?}

Both the Stanford and MIT websites are massively complex and thus some human error is unsurprising.
We used a tool on both sites to determine how much human error was present.

In the entirety of the site, there were seven bad links or pages according to the tool at
\url{http://validator.w3.org/checklink}. See
\href{http://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=mit.edu&hide_type=all&depth=&check=Check#results1}{results}
for the results for MIT's site. Thus the site has successfully eliminated nearly all of its
human error problems as far as navigation is concerned.

\subsection*{Can I do what I came here to do?}

Given that the purpose of visiting the site was to learn what was to be learned about the
opportunities for graduate study in computer science at MIT, the task was rather difficult.

Learning about the opportunities for graduate and doctoral study ranged in difficulty from
determining the various areas of study within computer science one could specialize in
for a graduate or doctoral degree, which was reasonably challenging but doable with a
nontrivial amount of effort, to determining how much it would cost to get either a master's
or doctoral degree, which was not possible within the several hours spent navigating through
the site assuming one limited oneself to only using the MIT website, and its searching
functionalities, and not emailing faculty or staff.

The difficulty of finding this information, which would be useful to many individuals, was
quite dissappointing. This information should have been accessible with minimal effort, and
despite the overal good design of the site's hierarchy it was not.

The designers of the MIT site, specifically the site designed for the Computer Science Department,
should have required a more readable and accessible envronment to display information. A better
thought out menu would have been enormously helpful, and having clearly differentiated pages with
relavent information on them would also have helped. More focus on the information needed by new 
prospective students rather than the individual members of the department, be they students or 
faculty, would have made the process of learning about MIT and what it has to offer much more 
straightforward.

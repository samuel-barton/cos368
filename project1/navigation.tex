\section*{Organization and Navigation}
\subsection*{Site Organization --- Clear or Intractable?}

Initially the MIT system is straightforward but it very quickly breaks down as while
the organization is hierarchical once you descend down into some sub portion of
the site, there is often no good way to get back to the home page, or even some
intermediary parent page. Some of the links are clearly labeled, but others are
nothing more than a hyperlinked number.

The home page is a portal from where you can get to wherever you need to go, and
From there the site becomes inconsistent. This is jarring at times, and it makes
navigating from one sublevel of the hierarchy to another without going back to the
parent level nearly, if not entirely, impossible.
